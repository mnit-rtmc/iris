# Action Plans

Select `View ➔ Plans and Schedules` menu item

*Action plans* provide a way to automate and coördinate control of devices, such
as [DMS]s and [ramp meter]s.

Action plans have a [phase](#plan-phases), which is chosen from a preconfigured
set.  It can be changed by an operator, or at specified times with
[time actions](#time-actions).

Each phase can be associated with any number of [DMS](#dms-actions),
[ramp meter](#meter-actions), [camera](#camera-actions), or
[beacon](#beacon-actions) actions.  Advanced plans can have many phases, each
with separate actions.

If **Sync Actions** is selected, the phase can only be changed if all associated
devices are online.  If **Sticky** is selected, messages sent with
[DMS actions](#dms-actions) will be configured to persist even if communication
or power is lost.

## Plan Phases

The basic phases are **deployed** and **undeployed**.  Additional phases can be
added on the **Plan Phases** tab.  Each phase must have a unique name.
By specifying **Hold Time**, a *transient* phase will advance automatically to
the **Next Phase**.  *Hold Time* must be a multiple of 30 seconds.

## DMS Actions

[DMS] actions have an associated *hashtag* to determine which signs are
affected by the action.  The action happens when the corresponding action plan
phase is selected.  The [message pattern] indicates which message is activated.
If **flash beacon** is selected, the sign's _internal_ beacon will also be
activated.  [Message priority] determines the priority of messages created by
the action.

### DMS Action Tags

Some *[MULTI]-like* tags are supported in [message pattern]s used by DMS
actions.  These tags are interpreted by IRIS before sending the message to the
DMS.  NOTE: they are **only** usable in action plan messages - not
operator-selected ones.

Tag              | Description
-----------------|------------------
`[cg` *…* `]`    | [ClearGuide] data
`[exit` *…* `]`  | [Exit ramp backup]
`[feed` *…* `]`  | [Msg-Feed] message
`[pa` *…* `]`    | [Parking area] availability
`[slow` *…* `]`  | [Slow traffic] warning
`[standby]`      | Standby messages
`[ta` *…* `]`    | Scheduled [time actions](#time-action-tag)
`[tt` *…* `]`    | [Travel time] estimation
`[tz` *…* `]`    | [Toll zone] pricing
`[vsa]`          | [Variable speed advisory]

## Meter Actions

A [ramp meter] action causes the meter to begin metering when the specified
*phase* is selected.  When the plan is set to any other phase, the meter will
shut off.

## Camera Actions

A [camera] action causes a specific [preset] to be recalled when the specified
*phase* is selected.

## Beacon Actions

A [beacon] action can cause a beacon to be deployed when the action plan is set
to the specified *phase*.  When the plan is set to any other phase, the beacon
will shut off.

## Time Actions

A *time action* automatically changes the phase at specified dates and times.
These events are scheduled using either a [day plan](#day-plans) or a specific
date (but not both).  A time of day must also be specified (HH:MM in 24-hour
format).  Whenever the scheduled time occurs, the action plan will be changed to
the specified phase.

## Time Action Tag

The time of a scheduled **time action** can be displayed in DMS messages using
[DMS actions](#dms-actions) within the same action plan.  A `[ta` *…* `]`
[action tag](#dms-action-tag) in the [message pattern] will be replaced with the
appropriate value.  It has the following format:

`[ta` *dir*,*format* `]`

**Parameters**

1. `dir`: Chronological direction
   - `n`: **Next** scheduled *time action* after the current time
   - `p`: **Previous** scheduled *time action* before the current time
2. `format`: Time format pattern (`h a` if omitted)

The format parameter is specified using a Java [DateTimeFormatter] pattern,
summarized in this table:

Symbol | Meaning
-------|------------
h      | hour (1-12)
H      | hour of day (0-23)
mm     | minute (00-59)
a      | AM or PM
E      | weekday (*e.g.* Mon)
EEEE   | full weekday (*e.g.* Monday)
d      | day of month (1-31)
M      | month number (1-12)
L      | month (*e.g.* Jan)
LLLL   | full month (*e.g.* January)

The default pattern, `h a`, would format a time at 2 in the afternoon as `2 PM`.
To include minutes, `h:mm a` could be used instead.

### Example 1

```
ROAD WORK[nl]STARTING AT [tan,h:mm a]
```

If next scheduled time action is at 2:30 AM, the resulting message will be:

```
ROAD WORK
STARTING AT 2:30 AM
```

### Example 2

```
BLIZZARD WARNING[nl]FROM [tap][nl]UNTIL [tan]
```

If the time is between two scheduled time actions, 4 AM to 10 PM, the message
will be:

```
BLIZZARD WARNING
FROM 4 AM
UNTIL 10 PM
```

## Day Plans

A day plan is a set of days which can be used for scheduling.  Day plans are
specified with a table of **day matchers**.  The matchers for a day plan
determine whether a specific day is included in the plan or not.  Day matchers
flagged as **holidays** are excluded.  Day matchers are specified by **Month**,
**Day**, **Week** and **Weekday**.  Any day which matches **all** specified
fields will match.  **Shift** is only required for days like *Black Friday*
(Fourth Thursday of November **+1**).

## Manual Control

On the **Plan** tab of the client interface, users can manually change the phase
of an action plan.  If the user is in the list specified by the
`action_plan_alert_list` [system attribute], an email will be sent to the
address specified by the `email_recipient_action_plan` [system attribute].

## Events

Whenever an action plan phase changes, a time-stamped record is added to the
`action_plan_event` table.  These events are purged automatically when older
than the value of the `action_plan_event_purge_days` [system attribute].
