# Action Plans

Select `View ‚ûî Plans and Schedules` menu item

*Action plans* provide a way to automate and cooÃàrdinate control of devices, such
as [DMS]s and [ramp meter]s.

- **Notes**: administrator notes, possibly including [hashtag]s, which can be
  used for restricting [permission]s
- **Sync Actions**: if selected, the phase can only be changed if all associated
  devices are online.
- **Sticky**: if selected, messages sent with [device actions](#device-actions)
  will be configured to persist even if communication or power is lost.
- **Ignore Auto-Fail**: if selected, [device action](#device-actions) messages
  will ignore detector [auto-fail] (`[exit` *‚Ä¶* `]` or `[slow` *‚Ä¶* `]` only)

## Plan Phases

A plan phase is used to associate [device actions](#device-actions) with a plan.
The current phase can be changed by an operator, or at specified times with
[time actions](#time-actions).

A phase can be associated with any number of device actions.  Advanced
plans can have many phases, each with separate actions.

The basic phases are **deployed** and **undeployed**.  Additional phases can be
added on the **Plan Phases** tab.  Each phase must have a unique name.
By specifying **Hold Time**, a *transient* phase will advance automatically to
the **Next Phase**.  *Hold Time* must be a multiple of 30 seconds.

## Device Actions

Device actions use [hashtag]s to associate devices with one phase of an action
plan.  These devices can be:
 - [DMS], displays the [message pattern] on the sign
 - [ramp meter], enables metering operation
 - [beacon], activates flashing lights
 - [camera], recalls the specified camera [preset]

[Priority] determines the priority of messages created by the action.  For
camera actions, instead this indicates:
* `1-12` a [preset] number to recall (ignored if the camera is associated
  with an [incident])
* `15` activate wiper

### Action Tags

A device action [message pattern] is a message to display on a device.  These
patterns support additional *action tags* which are not valid [MULTI].  They
are only usable in device actions - not operator-composed messages.

**Replace** tags are substituted with computed text before being sent to a
sign.  For example, a `[tt` *‚Ä¶* `]` tag will be replaced with the current
estimated travel time.  These tags can be used only on DMS devices.

**Condition** tags add a stipulation which activates the device only when the
condition is met.  These tags can be used with any device type, such as a
flashing [beacon].

Tag              | Description                      | Tag Mode            | Source
-----------------|----------------------------------|---------------------|-------------
`[cg` *‚Ä¶* `]`    | [ClearGuide] data                | Condition + Replace | `clearguide`
`[exit` *‚Ä¶* `]`  | [Exit ramp backup]               | Condition           | `exit_warning`
`[feed` *‚Ä¶* `]`  | [Msg-Feed] message               | Replace             | N/A
`[pa` *‚Ä¶* `]`    | [Parking area] availability      | Replace             | `parking`
`[rwis_` *‚Ä¶* `]` | [RWIS] weather conditions        | Condition           | `rwis`
`[slow` *‚Ä¶* `]`  | [Slow traffic] warning           | Condition + Replace | `slow_warning`
`[standby]`      | Standby messages                 | Standby             | `standby`
`[ta` *‚Ä¶* `]`    | [Time actions](#time-action-tag) | Replace             | N/A
`[tt` *‚Ä¶* `]`    | [Travel time] estimation         | Replace             | `travel_time`
`[tz` *‚Ä¶* `]`    | [Toll zone] pricing              | Replace             | `tolling`
`[vsa]`          | [Variable speed advisory]        | Condition + Replace | `speed_advisory`

## Time Actions

A *time action* automatically changes the phase at specified dates and times.
These events are scheduled using either a [day plan](#day-plans) or a specific
date (but not both).  A time of day must also be specified (HH:MM in 24-hour
format).  Whenever the scheduled time occurs, the action plan will be changed to
the specified phase.

## Time Action Tag

The time of a scheduled **time action** can be displayed in DMS messages using
[device actions](#device-actions) within the same action plan.  A `[ta` *‚Ä¶* `]`
[action tag](#action-tags) in the [message pattern] will be replaced with the
appropriate value.  It has the following format:

`[ta` *dir*,*format* `]`

**Parameters**

1. `dir`: Chronological direction
   - `n`: **Next** scheduled *time action* after the current time
   - `p`: **Previous** scheduled *time action* before the current time
2. `format`: Time format pattern (`h a` if omitted)

The format parameter is specified using a Java [DateTimeFormatter] pattern,
summarized in this table:

Symbol | Meaning
-------|------------
h      | hour (1-12)
H      | hour of day (0-23)
mm     | minute (00-59)
a      | AM or PM
E      | weekday (*e.g.* Mon)
EEEE   | full weekday (*e.g.* Monday)
d      | day of month (1-31)
M      | month number (1-12)
L      | month (*e.g.* Jan)
LLLL   | full month (*e.g.* January)

The default pattern, `h a`, would format a time at 2 in the afternoon as `2 PM`.
To include minutes, `h:mm a` could be used instead.

### Example 1

```
ROAD WORK[nl]STARTING AT [tan,h:mm a]
```

If next scheduled time action is at 2:30 AM, the resulting message will be:

```
ROAD WORK
STARTING AT 2:30 AM
```

### Example 2

```
BLIZZARD WARNING[nl]FROM [tap][nl]UNTIL [tan]
```

If the time is between two scheduled time actions, 4 AM to 10 PM, the message
will be:

```
BLIZZARD WARNING
FROM 4 AM
UNTIL 10 PM
```

## Day Plans

A day plan is a set of days which can be used for scheduling.  They contain
a table of **day matchers**, which specify either active days or holidays,
depending on the **holidays** flag.  A matcher contains 5 fields, which can
be `NULL` for "any":

- **Month** (1-12)
- **Day** (1-31)
- **Weekday** (1-7)
- **Week** (1-4, or -1 for last)
- **Shift** - only needed for days like *Black Friday*
  (Fourth Thursday of November **+1**)

## Manual Control

On the **Plan** tab of the client interface, users can manually change the
phase of an action plan.  In addition to having "Operate" access [permission]
for action plans, the user must have it for all associated device actions
(every device using the matching hashtag).

## Events

Whenever an action plan phase changes, a time-stamped [event] record can be
stored in the `action_plan_event` table.

When a user changes the phase, if they are in the list specified by the
`action_plan_alert_list` [system attribute], an email event will be logged to
the `email_event` table.
