<h1>MnDOT Traffic Data Archive</h1>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
	For many years, MnDOT has collected traffic data from sensors
	(detectors) embedded in the roadway.
	As of October 2006, data is being collected every 30 seconds from more
	than 4500 detectors in the Twin Cities metro area.
	This raw data usually consists of volume (number of vehicles, sometimes
	called "flow") and occupancy (percentage of time a detector is
	"occupied").
	As you might guess, this adds up to a very large amount of data every
	day.
	There is so much data that the advantages of storing it in a
	traditional database are far outweighed by the complications.
	This data storage problem led to the development of the MnDOT
	<b>Traffic Data Archive</b>, in March 2000.
	Freeway data from January 1994 onwards is available in this format.
</p>
<h2>Advantages</h2>
<p>
	There are many benefits to the traffic data archive format.
	Probably the most important benefit is simplicity.
	Earlier file formats had complicated bit field manipulation, which made
	it harder to develop data analysis tools.
	This problem has been eliminated, since all data is stored as either
	8-bit or 16-bit binary integers.
	Another benefit is the compactness of the format.
	In earlier formats, this quantity of data would occupy 33 megabytes
	(MB) of disk space.
	In this format, the same data is compressed into about 13 MB (with no
	loss of precision).
	Another problem with earlier formats was the distinction between
	30-second, 5-minute, and station samples made accessing the data more
	complex than it needed to be.
	This format unifies all the data into a single file, simplifying the
	software needed to access the data.
	Another key benefit of the format is extensibility.
	It is possible to add different types of data (such as speed, vehicle
	classification, etc.) to the format without sacrificing backward
	compatibility.
</p>
<h2>File Format</h2>
<p>
	Each traffic data file consists of one day's worth of traffic data.
	The files are conventionally named with an eight-digit date (four-digit
	year, two-digit month and two-digit day), plus an extension of
	".traffic".
	For example, a file called "20000323.traffic" would contain all the
	detector data for March 23, 2000.
	The file itself is actually in the popular ZIP compression format,
	making it easy to extract data using tools such as WinZip.
</p>
<p>
	Within the traffic archive, there will be one or more files for each
	detector.
	These files are named according to the detector from which the data was
	collected.
	The base file name is the detector ID, and the filename extension
	determines the type of sample data.
	For example, 30-second volume samples collected from detector ID 100
	would be stored in a file called "100.v30".

<h3>30-second Sample Data</h3>
<p>
	The 30-second sample files (.?30) contain binned sample data for all
	2880 30-second periods in the day.
	The first sample represents the first 30-seconds of the day (midnight
	to 00:00:30), and the last sample is the last 30-seconds of the day
	(23:59:30 to midnight).
	Each data sample is either an 8 or 16 bit signed integer, depending on
	the sample type.
	16-bit samples are in high-byte first order.
	A negative value (-1) indicates a missing sample.
	Any data outside the valid ranges should be considered "bad".
</p>
<p>
	The .v30 sample data is the number of vehicles sampled at the detector
	in 30 seconds.
	A volume sample of 40 vehicles or higher should never happen in the
	real world, since that represents a sustained average headway of 0.75
	seconds between vehicles.
</p>
<p>
	The .o30 format is now obsolete, having been replaced by the
	more-precise .c30 format.
	Scans are defined as 1/60 second, so the valid range for a sample is 0
	to 1800 (30 seconds * 60 scans/second).
	The old .o30 files are in 1/10th percent occupancy, so they range from
	0 to 1000.
	That is the only difference between the two file formats.
	If you want to get numbers in the range of 0 to 100, divide scan data
	by 18 or occupancy data by 10.
</p>
<p>
	The .s30 sample data is raw speed data from radar or microwave sensors.
	Each sample is the average speed in miles/hour.
</p>
<h3>Individual Vehicle Logging</h3>
<p>
	The .vlog data is a text (ascii) format with one line for each vehicle
	detection event.
	Duration, headway, and speed can be logged using the .vlog format.
	Values are separated by commas, and missing data is represented by a
	'?' field.
	A gap in the sampling data is represented by a '*' on a line by itself.
