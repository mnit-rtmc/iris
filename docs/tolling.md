# Tolling

High-occupancy / toll (HOT) lanes can be operated through IRIS.  Functions
include calculating tolls in real time based on density, displaying prices on
DMS, and logging vehicle transponder (tag) information.  Customer accounts and
billing are not supported; those features must be provided by an external
system.

## Toll Zones

Select `View ➔ Lane Use ➔ Toll Zones` menu item

A toll zone is a segment of roadway between two [station]s.  All HOT lane
detectors between the starting station and ending station can be used to
calculate the toll.  Every 3 minutes, tolls are calculated using data from the
most recent 6 minutes.  Within a zone, each station has an associated toll,
based on the highest density _k_ recorded among HOT lane detectors downstream of
that station.

p = α ⋅ k <sup>β</sup>

* α is the value of the `toll_density_alpha` [system attribute], default 0.045
* β is the value of the `toll_density_beta` [system attribute], default 1.10
* p is the calculated price

The toll price is then rounded to the nearest $0.25.

## Pricing on DMS

The toll price can be displayed in DMS messages using [DMS actions].  A
`[tz` *…* `]` [action tag] in the [message pattern] will be replaced with the
appropriate value.  It has the following format:

`[tz` *mode,{tz0},…{tzn}* `]`

**Parameters**

1. `mode`: Tolling mode:
   - `p`: _priced_
   - `o`: _open_
   - `c`: _closed_
2. `tz0`: First toll zone ID
3. `tz1` - `tzn`: (Optional) additional toll zone IDs

If the tolling mode is _priced_, the tag will be replaced with the calculated
price, for example `2.75`.  It will be the sum of prices for all specified toll
zones.  The values of the `toll_min_price` and `toll_max_price`
[system attribute]s limit the calculated price.

For _open_ and _closed_ modes, the tag will be replaced with an empty string.
If required, a message such as `OPEN` or `CLOSED` may be appended after the tag.

### Price Message Events

_Price events_ are logged when a message is sent to a DMS, and again when the
message is verified.  The price event includes the **date and time**,
**DEPLOYED** or **VERIFIED** status, **DMS id**, **toll zone**, _highest
density_ **detector(s)** and **price**.

The logged _toll zone_ is the last zone specified in the tag.  In _priced_ mode,
the displayed price is logged.  For _open_ or _closed_, a price of 0 is logged.

These records are purged automatically when older than the value of the
`price_message_event_purge_days` [system attribute].

## Tag Readers

Select `View ➔ Lane Use ➔ Tag Readers` menu item

A tag reader is a sensor for in-vehicle transponders (tags).  They can be
mounted over a tolled lane to record customer trips.  These are typically
located just downstream of a pricing DMS.

### Tag Read Events

When a tag is read, an event is logged in the `tag_read_event` database table.
The event includes the **date and time**, **tag ID**, **toll zone** and
**tollway**.  This can be combined with the price message events to build a list
of trips for each tag ID.  This information can be used to bill customers.

These records are purged automatically when older than the value of the
`tag_read_event_purge_days` [system attribute].
