# Permissions

**Permissions** are a newer access control feature intended to replace
[capabilities] and [privileges].  For now, they determine permissions for web
access only.

* `iris/api/permission/{id}`
* `iris/api/access`

| Access       | Minimal                               |
|--------------|---------------------------------------|
| Read Only    | id                                    |
| 🔧 Configure | role, resource\_n, hashtag, access\_n |

</details>

## Setup

[Role] is the user role associated with the permissions.

[Resource] is the `type` part of the URI.

[Hashtag] restricts the permission to resources which have the assigned tag.
Permissions containing hashtags are only checked for updates to existing
resources, not creation/deletion.

There are 4 **access** levels, with increasing permissiveness:

| Level | Access       | Permissions              |
|-------|--------------|--------------------------|
|     1 | 👁️  View      | Monitor / read           |
|     2 | 👉 Operate   | + Control                |
|     3 | 💡 Manage    | + Policies, scheduling   |
|     4 | 🔧 Configure | + Create, update, delete |

When checks are performed, the **highest** access level of matching permissions
is used.
