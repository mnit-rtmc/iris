# Natch Protocol

Natch is a protocol for communicating with ATC devices.  It may or may not stand
for New Advanced Traffic Controller, Howdy.

The controller listens and accepts a single TCP connection on port 8001.  The
IRIS server connects and keeps the same connection open continuously.

Immediately after connecting, IRIS will send configuration messages to the
controller.  These include ramp meter and detector configuration.

## Messages

Each message is a single line of comma-separated values (UTF-8), terminated
with a newline character `\n` (U+000A).

The first value in a message is a __code__ indicating a message type.  For a
poll (from IRIS) these codes are upper-case.  For responses or asynchronous
detector counts (from the controller), the codes are lower-case.

The second value is a __message identifier__.  It is used to match polls with
responses, but is otherwise not interpreted by the controller.  Asynchronous
detector messages use a sequence number which increments automatically.

Code | Descripton
-----|----------------
CS   | Clock status
DC   | Detector configure
DS   | Detector status
MC   | Meter configure
MS   | Meter status
MT   | Meter timing table
PS   | Pin status
SC   | System command (restart)

### CS - Clock Status

The third value is date and time formatted according to [RFC 3339].  If the
third value is omittet in a poll, the response contains the current time.

```
CS,00AB,2021-04-01T12:34:56-05:00
cs,00AB,2021-04-01T12:34:56-05:00
CS,00AC
cs,00AC,2021-04-01T12:34:59-05:00
```

### DC - Detector Configure

The third value is the detector number (0-31).  The fourth value is the input
pin.  If the pin is not a valid input pin, the detector is *deleted*, and the
response indicates this with pin 0.  If the fourth value is omitted in a poll,
it is treated as a *query*, and the response includes the currently configured
pin.

The fourth value can also be set to a ramp meter output pin (2 or 3).  In this
case, whenever a green indication (on either head) is displayed, it generates a
detector status event.

```
DC,00AD,0,39
dc,00AD,0,39
DC,00AE,0
dc,00AE,0,39
```

### DS - Detector Status

When a vehicle leaves a detector, a detector status messages is added to a
fixed-size ring buffer, with head and tail pointers.  The __message identifier__
is incremented as a 16-bit hex value.

When this happens, the oldest message is sent by the controller, unless waiting
for an ACK from a previous message.

When a poll is received, the __message identifier__ is compared with the last
sent status message.  If it matches, the poll is an ACK, otherwise it is a NAK.

On ACK, the tail pointer is incremented, "deleting" the message.  If there are
more messages in the ring buffer, the oldest one is then sent.

On NAK, the oldest status message is sent again.

The third value is the detector number (0-31).  The fourth through sixth values
are __duration__, __headway__ and __time__.  See [vehicle logging] for details.

```
ds,01a5,3,323,4638,17:50:28
DS,01a5
```

### MC - Meter Configure

The third value is the meter number (0-3).  The fourth value is the number of
meter heads.  If any of the values are not valid, the meter is *deleted*, and
the response indicates this.  If there are only three values in the poll, it is
treated as a *query*, and the response includes the current meter configuration.

Value | Description
------|-------------------
3     | Meter number (0-3)
4     | Heads (0-2)
5     | Start up green time (0.1 sec)
6     | Start up yellow time (0.1 sec)
7     | Turn on output pin (usually 2 or 3)
8     | Red output pin, left head
9     | Yellow output pin, left head
10    | Green output pin, left head
11    | Red output pin, right head
12    | Yellow output pin, right head
13    | Green output pin, right head

```
MC,0150,0,2,13,7,2,4,5,6,7,8,9
mc,0150,0,2,13,7,2,4,5,6,7,8,9
MC,0151,0
mc,0151,0,2,13,7,2,4,5,6,7,8,9
MC,0152,1,0
mc,0152,1,0
```

### MS - Meter Status

The third value is the meter number.  The fourth is the red dwell time, in 0.1
second increments.  If set to zero, metering is disabled.  If there are only
three values in a poll, it is treated as a *query*, and the response includes
the current red dwell time.

```
MS,00AC,0
ms,00AC,0,45
```

### MT - Meter Timing Table

The third value is the table entry number (0-15).  The fourth value is the meter
number (0-3).  If any of the values are not valid, the table entry is *deleted*,
zeroing out values 4-7, and the response indicates this.  If there are only
three values in the poll, it is treated as a *query*, and the response includes
the current table entry configuration.

Value | Description
------|--------------------------
3     | Table entry number (0-15)
4     | Meter number (0-3)
5     | Start time (minute of day; 0-1439)
6     | Stop time (minute of day; 0-1439)
7     | Red dwell time (0.1 sec)

```
MT,0234,0
mt,0234,0,1,420,510,65
MT,0235,1,1,900,1080,73
mt,0235,1,1,900,1080,73
MT,0236,2,XX
mt,0235,2,0,0,0,0
```

### PS - Pin Status

The third value is the pin number.  The fourth is the pin status (0 or 1).  If
omitted in a poll, it is treated as a *query*, and the response includes the
current status.

__Note__: pins associated with meters (Meter Configure) cannot be controlled
with this command.

```
PS,0250,70
ps,0250,70,0
PS,0251,19,1
ps,0251,19,1
```

### SC - System Command

The third value is the command.  `restart` causes the controller program to be
restarted.

```
SC,05c1,restart
sc,05c1,restart
```
