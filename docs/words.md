# Words

Select `View ➔ Message Signs ➔ Words` menu item

Words can either be **banned** or **allowed** for use in messages.

If an operator has **Manage** [permissions] for a [DMS], they can enter
free-form text as long as none of the words are banned.

Allowed Words are used for automatic [abbreviation] of [incident] messages,
when necessary.
