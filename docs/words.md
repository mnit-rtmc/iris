# Words

Select `View ➔ Message Signs ➔ Words` menu item

Words can either be **banned** or **allowed** for use in messages.

If an operator has **Manage** [permissions] for a [DMS], they can enter
free-form text as long as none of the words are banned.

## Abbreviation

_Allowed_ words are used for automatic abbreviation of [message lines] and
[incident] messages, when necessary.

On lines which are too wide, a single word is chosen and replaced with its
abbreviated form.  If it's still too wide, the process repeats.  If a message
doesn't fit after all possible words have been abbreviated, it is discarded.
