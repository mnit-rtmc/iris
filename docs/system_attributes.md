# System Attributes

Select `View ➔ System ➔ System Attributes` menu item

A _system attribute_ is a configurable value which can be used to customize the
IRIS system.  Each attribute has a corresponding type: _string_, _boolean_,
_integer_ or _floating point_ number.

* _String_ values are limited to 64 characters or less
* _Boolean_ values must be specified as either `true` or `false`
* Numeric attributes can be constrained to a minimum and maximum bound,
  depending on the attribute.

When a _system attribute_ has been modified from its default value, it will be
displayed in **bold** on the **System Attributes** form.

Most attribute changes take effect immediately, but some require the IRIS client
or server to be restarted.
