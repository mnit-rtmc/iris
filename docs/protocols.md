# Protocols

A [comm link] communicates with remote [controller]s using one of several
protocols, each of which supports specific [device] types.  Some also
support **multi-drop** addressing, with more than one controller per
_comm link_.

## Axis PTZ

The `axisptz` protocol can be used for [PTZ] control of Axis [camera]s.  The
_default scheme_ is `http`.  _Multi-drop_ is not supported.  One camera can be
associated with each [controller], using [IO pin] 1.

## Canoga

The `canoga` protocol can collect [vehicle detection] data, with
[vehicle logging] instead of [binned data].  The _default scheme_ is `tcp`.
_Multi-drop_ is supported with drops 0 - 15 (backplane) or 128 - 255 (EEPROM).
Up to 4 detectors can be associated with each [controller], using [IO pin]s
1 - 4.

## CAP

The Common Alerting Protocol [CAP] is used for polling external feeds such as
the Integrated Public Alert and Warning System [IPAWS].  [Alerts] can be used
to automatically post weather and other messages to Dynamic Message Signs.  For
IPAWS, this requires an `HTTPS` URI provided by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency and a [controller] set to `ACTIVE` condition.

## CBW

The `cbw` protocol can be used for [beacons], using a Control-By-Web controller.
The _default scheme_ is `http`.  _Multi-drop_ is not supported.  Depending on
the model, up to 16 [beacons] can be associated with each [controller].

The [IO Pin]s are outputs for controlling relays.

| Model Number | IO Pins |
|--------------|---------|
| X-WR-1R12    | 1       |
| X-301        | 1 - 2   |
| X-401        | 1 - 2   |
| X-310        | 1 - 4   |
| X-410        | 1 - 4   |
| X-WR-10R12   | 1 - 10  |
| X-332        | 1 - 16  |

## ClearGuide

external system feed.

## Cohu

The `cohu` protocol can be used for [PTZ] control of Cohu [camera]s.  The

[parking area] monitoring.  The _default scheme_ is `tcp`.  _Multi-drop_ is not
supported.  Up to 76 detectors can be associated with each [controller], using
[IO pin]s 11 - 86.

## E6

The `e6` protocol can be used for collecting data from Transcore [tag readers].
The _default scheme_ is `udp`.  _Multi-drop_ is not supported.  One tag reader
can be associated with each [controller], using [IO pin] 1.

## G4

The `G4` protocol can collect [vehicle detection] data, including _vehicle
counts_, _occupancy_, _speed_ and _vehicle classification_.  The
_default scheme_ is `tcp`.  _Multi-drop_ is supported with drops 0 - 65535.
Up to 12 detectors can be associated with each [controller], using [IO pin]s
1 - 12.

## Inc-Feed

The `incfeed` protocol can be used to interface IRIS with an external system
that generates [incidents].  Periodically, IRIS will poll the URI (using `http`)
for incidents.

### Incident Feed Format

The external system should respond with an ASCII text file, with one line per
active incident.

Each line should contain 7 fields, separated by comma characters `,` and
terminated with a single newline character `\n` (ASCII 0x0A).  The fields are:

1. **incident ID**
2. **type**: `CRASH`, `STALL`, `ROADWORK` or `HAZARD`
3. **incident detail**: may be blank, or one of the _incident detail_ names
4. **latitude**
5. **longitude**
6. **camera ID**: may be blank, or the ID of a [camera] to view the incident
7. **direction**: `NB`, `SB`, `EB` or `WB`

_Latitude_ and _longitude_ define coördinates using the WGS 84 datum.

## Infinova

The `infinova` protocol can be used for [PTZ] control of Infinova [camera]s.
The _default scheme_ is `tcp`.  _Multi-drop_ is supported with drops 1 - 254.
One camera can be associated with each [controller], using [IO pin] 1.

## Manchester

One camera can be associated with each [controller], using [IO pin] 1.

## MnDOT-170

170 style controllers running the _MnDOT 170_ firmware can support several types
of [device]s:

Device Type         | `#` | [IO Pin]s
--------------------|-----|----------
[vehicle detection] | 24  | 39 - 62
[ramp meters]       | 2   | 2 - 3
[changeable LCS]    | 3   | 19 - 36
[beacons]           | 1   | 2
[alarms]            | 10  | 70 - 79

There are two versions of the protocol supported:

Version   | Default Scheme | Multi-Drop
----------|----------------|-----------
4         | `tcp`          | 1 - 15
5         | `tcp`          | 1 - 31

## MonStream

The `monstream` protocol can be used for switching of [monstream] video
monitors.  The _default scheme_ is `udp`.  _Multi-drop_ is not supported.
Up to 16 [video monitors] can be associated with each [controller], using
[IO pin]s 1 - 16.

## Msg-Feed

The `msgfeed` protocol can be used to interface with an external system that
generates [DMS] messages.  Periodically, IRIS will poll the URI (using `http`)
for DMS messages.

The external system should respond with an ASCII text file, with one line per
message to be deployed.  Each line contains 3 fields: `dms`, `message` and
`expire`, separated by tab characters `\t` (ASCII 0x09), and terminated with a
single newline character `\n` (ASCII 0x0A).

```
V66E37\tSNOW PLOW[nl]AHEAD[nl]USE CAUTION\t2022-10-02 11:37:00-05:00
```

`dms`: Name of the sign to deploy, which must have the [hashtag] referenced
by a [DMS action].  Additionally, that action must be associated with the
current phase of an active [action plan].  The [message pattern] of the
_DMS action_ must be a `feed` [action tag].  For example, if the `msgfeed`
_Comm Link_ name is `XYZ`, then the pattern must be `[feedXYZ]`.

`multi`: Message to deploy, using the [MULTI] markup language.  Each line of
the message must exist in the pattern's library.  This check allows only
"administrator-approved" messages, but it can be disabled by changing the
`msg_feed_verify` [system attribute] to `false`.  **WARNING**: only disable
this check if the message feed host is fully trusted, and there is no
possibility of man-in-the-middle attacks.

`expire`: Date/time when the message will expire, using [RFC 3339]
`full-date` / `full-time` separated by a space.  The message will not be
displayed after this time.  Leave `expire` blank to cancel a previous message.

## Natch

Advanced Traffic Controllers (ATC) using the [Natch protocol] can support
several types of [device]s:

- [alarms]
- [beacons]
- [changeable LCS]
- [ramp meters]
- [vehicle detection]
