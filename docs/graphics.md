Image editing, resizing, painting, *etc.* is not supported - graphics must be
edited and sized properly before importing into the IRIS image library.  Use an
image editor such as [GIMP] or Microsoft Paint for this purpose.

Requirements:

- 1-bit monochrome or 24-bit color
- PNG or GIF image format
- Width between 1 and 240 pixels
- Height between 1 and 144 pixels

To import a graphic, enable [edit mode] and press the **Create** button.
Select the image in the file picker.

A single **Transparent Color** can be selected to be fully transparent - alpha
transparency is not supported. 

Each image has a unique **Graphic Number**, between 1 and 999.  If the number
is below 256, it can be used in a [MULTI] `[g`...`]` tag to display the graphic
on a sign message.

A graphic can also be used to represent a [static sign] with a smaller DMS
inset, if the graphic number is 256 or greater.  For example, a static sign
might contain a travel time message with a fixed destination, and the DMS inset
would only be large enough to display a 2-digit number of minutes.  The static
graphic is displayed when selecting the DMS, to help operators understand the
sign's function.
