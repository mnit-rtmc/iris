# Sign Messages

A sign message is an immutable record containing all information needed to
display a message on a [DMS].  They are created when operators [compose] them,
and also when [DMS actions] are scheduled.  They are deleted automatically
after being unused for a few minutes.

## Resources

* `iris/sign_message`
* `iris/img/{name}.gif`
* `iris/api/sign_message` (`POST`)

Attribute [permissions]:

| Access       | Minimal     | `multi` check on `POST` |
|--------------|-------------|-------------------------|
| Read Only    | name, sign\_config, incident, multi, msg\_owner, flash\_beacon, msg\_priority, duration |
| ðŸ‘‰ Operate   |             | Match `msg_pattern` with `compose_hashtag` |
| ðŸ’¡ Plan      |             | Dictionary [word] check |
| ðŸ”§ Configure |             | No check                |

[Sign configuration] determines the type of sign that can display the message.

The [MULTI] string contains the text and/or [graphics] of the message.

The **msg_owner** is a string containing 3 fields, separated by semicolons
(`system`; `sources`; `user`):
- `system`: normally "IRIS"; possibly another system
- `sources`: "operator" or [action tag] sources, separated by `+`
- `user`: name of user who created the message

**Flash Beacon** indicates whether an associated beacon should flash.

**Duration** determines how long a message will be displayed (minutes).

### Message Priority

Priority determines precedence between operator messages and [DMS actions].

| Low          | Medium           | High           |
|--------------|------------------|----------------|
| 1: `low_1`   | 6: `medium_1`    | 11: `high_1`   |
| 2: `low_2`   | 7: `medium_2`    | 12: `high_2`   |
| 3: `low_3`   | 8: `medium_3`    | 13: `high_3`   |
| 4: `low_4`   | 9: `medium_4`    | 14: `high_4`   |
| 5: `low_sys` | 10: `medium_sys` | 15: `high_sys` |

Messages composed by operators have `high_1` priority.  [Cleared incidents] use
the `low_sys` priority.  Messages sent by external systems are assigned to
`medium_sys`.
