# Gate Arms

Select `View ‚ûî Gate Arm Arrays` menu item

Gate arms are traffic control devices which restrict access to a section of
roadway.  They are commonly used for on-ramps or reversible lanes.

## Setup

The gate arm properties form has setup information.

Field      | Description
-----------|---------------------------------------------------
Notes      | administrator notes, possibly including [hashtag]s
Preset     | verification [camera] preset
Opposing   | interlock check for gates on this road in another direction
Downstream | [hashtag] for downstream gates which must open prior to this

A [hashtag] in the **notes** field is used to group arms that are controlled
as a unit.

The verification [camera] preset allows operators to check traffic conditions
before opening or closing the gates.  The _Swap_ button allows camera images
from multiple gates to be swapped between larger and smaller views.

Gate arms are controlled by [action plan]s with three phases:
- `ga_open`: gates and [DMS] both open
- `ga_warn_cls`: gates open, but DMS displaying closed message
- `ga_closed`: gates and DMS both closed

[Device action]s must be assigned to these phases to control devices:
- Gate arm hashtags should be assigned to `ga_open` and `ga_warn_cls`, but not
  `ga_close`.
- Different DMS messages can be displayed for each phase, as necessary.

## States and Interlocks

Gate arms are continuously monitored, and can be in one of these states:

State        | Description             | Possibly Open | Possibly Closed
-------------|-------------------------|---------------|----------------
`OPENING`    | opening in progress     | ‚úîÔ∏è             | ‚úîÔ∏è
`OPEN`       | gate open               | ‚úîÔ∏è             |
`CLOSING`    | closing in progress     | ‚úîÔ∏è             | ‚úîÔ∏è
`CLOSED`     | gate closed             |               | ‚úîÔ∏è
`FAULT`      | fault in gate operation | ‚úîÔ∏è             | ‚úîÔ∏è
`UNKNOWN`    | no commnuication        | ‚úîÔ∏è             | ‚úîÔ∏è

If communication is lost to a gate arm for longer than the value of
`gate_arm_alert_timeout_secs` [system attribute], its state will be set to
`UNKNOWN`.

A gate arm **interlock** can prevent dangerous traffic conflicts:
- **Deny Open** prevents opening the gate, due to opposing gates _possibly_
  open or downstream gates _possibly_ closed.
- **Deny Close** prevents closing the gate, due to upstream gates _possibly_
  open.
- **Deny All** prevents opening or closing the gate (both above conditions).
- **System Disable** prevents operating any gates.

If a constraint is broken, IRIS will never automatically try to resolve it.
Instead, an _alert_ will logged in the `email_event` table.

## Control

![](images/gate_arm_dispatch.png)

Depending on the current action plan phase, one of the buttons will be enabled.
When an operator presses a button, its corresponding phase will be requested:
- `Open` ‚áí `ga_open`
- `Warn Close` ‚áí `ga_warn_cls` ‚Ä†
- `Close` ‚áí `ga_closed`

‚Ä† `Warn Close` is only enabled if a [device action] is configured with the
`ga_warn_cls` phase.  Operators should use this phase to warn motorists when
the gates will soon be closing.  After checking the verification cameras, the
`ga_close` phase can be selected.

None of these phases can be requested automatically by the system -- an
operator must **manually** request them.

DMS messages for these are displayed to the right of the camera view, for up to
two signs.

## Security

There are a couple of extra security features to restrict access to gate arm
control.

### Allowlist

There is a list of IP addresses from which clients are allowed to control a
gate arm action plan.  It is specified as the `gate.arm.allowlist` property in
the `/etc/iris/iris-server.properties` configuration file.  The property
contains a list of addresses in [CIDR] notation (exact IP, or ranges specified
such as `192.168.1.0/24`).

### System Disable

Another security feature causes the entire _gate arm system_ to be disabled
whenever a configuration change is made to any gate arm.  This includes any
changes to a gate arm, [controller] or associated [comm link] or [action plan].
IRIS will not send any command to open or close any gate arm while in this
state.  The only way to re-enable gate arm control is to create a file in the
server filesystem at `/var/lib/iris/gate_arm_enable` (using the touch command).
