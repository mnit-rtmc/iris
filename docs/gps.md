# GPS

A portable [DMS] can have an associated GPS (global positioning system)
receiver.  This allows the sign to be tracked and automatically updated with
the nearest roadway and direction.

To create a GPS device, select the DMS and open its `Properties` form.  On the
`Location`, there are controls for configuring the associated GPS.  Once the
GPS is enabled, it must be associated with a controller.  Its name will be the
same as the DMS, with `_gps` appended.  For [NTCIP], the GPS should be
associated with the same controller as the DMS (using pin 2).  For [RedLion] or
[SierraGX], a new comm link and controller must be created to communicate with
the modem.

The GPS location will be polled on the _long poll period_ of the [comm config].
The `Query GPS` button can be used to manually poll the co√∂rdinates.
