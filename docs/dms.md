# Dynamic Message Signs (DMS)

Select `View ➔ Message Signs ➔ DMS` menu item

A _dynamic message sign_ (DMS) is a sign which is capable of changing the
message displayed to motorists.  They can be classified as _character-matrix_,
_line-matrix_ or _full-matrix_ depending on the spacing between pixels.  Some
are monochrome and others support full color display.  All of these
configurations are supported.

The following features are supported:

* Querying currently displayed message
* Sending and displaying new messages
* Querying configuration information
* Querying diagnostic information
* Querying or sending [fonts]
* Sending [graphic images] to be displayed
* [Travel time] estimation
* [Variable speed advisories]
* [Slow traffic] warnings
* Checking banned or allowed [word] lists

## Setup

The DMS properties form can be used to configure the sign.

Field          | Description
---------------|--------------------------------------------------
Remote beacon  | beacon activated automatically when sign deployed
Static graphic | image of static sign in which DMS is inset
Device purpose | _general_ or _dedicated_ purpose for sign operation
Hidden         | hide sign when _available_ or _deployed_ styles are selected

**Internal** beacons are controlled through the DMS controller using the [NTCIP]
protocol.  **Remote** [beacon]s are controlled using a separate [comm link].

_Sign groups_ and associated _sign text_ libraries can be managed in the
**Messages** tab.

All sign groups are displayed in the table, even if the DMS is not a member of
that group.  To add the DMS to a group, select the _Member_ check box.

When a sign group is selected, its message library is displayed in the _sign
text_ table.  Each row contains a message for one _line_ of the sign.  The
_rank_ determines sort order in message lists.

The _message preview_ displays a graphical rendering of the selected sign text.

Select an _override font_ to use a font other than the _default font_ from the
sign configuration.

## Operating

Each DMS can have a number of _styles_, depending on its current state.  Styles
are ordered by precedence, determining which color a map marker is drawn.

Style     | Description
----------|---------------------------------------
Available | Sign is blank and ready to use
Deployed  | Displaying an operator-defined message
Schedule  | Displaying a scheduled message
External  | Displaying a message from an external system (not IRIS)
Maint.    | Sign requires maintenance, but might still be functional
Failed    | Communication failure to sign
Purpose   | _Dedicated-purpose_ sign (travel time, wayfinding, etc.)
All       | All signs

## Composing Messages

When a DMS is selected, a few things happen:
- the sign's location is displayed
- the current message is rendered
- the [message pattern] selector is populated with messages for sign groups
  containing the DMS and containing **NO** [action tags]
- if no pattern contains a text rectangle for composing with sign text, an
  "empty" pattern is provided

When a pattern is selected, a series of _Sign Text_ selectors is populated
with messages from the message library, depending on the text rectangles of
that pattern.  The message preview is updated as the message is being
composed.  Once complete, pressing the **Send** button will put the message
onto the DMS.
