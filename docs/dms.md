* Querying or sending [font]s

## Setup

The DMS properties form has setup information.

Field          | Description
---------------|---------------------------------------------------
Notes          | administrator notes, possibly including [hashtag]s
Remote beacon  | beacon activated automatically when sign deployed
Static graphic | image of static sign in which DMS is inset

**Internal** beacons are controlled through the DMS controller using the [NTCIP]
protocol.  **Remote** [beacon]s are controlled using a separate [comm link].

## Status JSON

Sign status data is stored as JSON in `status`.

Key              | Value
-----------------|--------------------------------------------------
`faults`         | Current fault conditions, separated by semicolons
`photocells`     | Array of objects: `description`, `error`, `reading`
`light_output`   | Integer light output percentage
`power_supplies` | Array of objects: `description`, `supply_type`, `error`, `detail`, `voltage`
`cabinet_temps`  | Array of integer temps (C)
`ambient_temps`  | Array of integer temps (C)
`housing_temps`  | Array of integer temps (C)

## Styles

Each DMS can have a number of _styles_, depending on its current state.  Styles
are ordered by precedence, determining which color a map marker is drawn.

Style     | Description
----------|---------------------------------------
Available | Sign is blank and ready to use
Deployed  | Displaying an operator-defined message
Schedule  | Displaying a scheduled message
External  | Displaying a message from an external system (not IRIS)
Fault     | One or more faults detected in sign
Offline   | Communication to sign offline
Purpose   | [Dedicated purpose] sign
All       | All signs

## Composing Messages

When a DMS is selected, the [message pattern] selector is populated:
  * only patterns whose **compose** [hashtag] matches the sign
  * only patterns containing **NO** [action tags]

When an operator chooses a pattern, a series of selectors is populated with
[message line]s, depending on the [fillable text rectangles].  Any lines which
are too wide to fit the sign are [abbreviated] as necessary.

The selectors may also allow **free-form text** entry, depending on the
**DMS** permision access level:

* üëâ **Operate**: No free-form text permitted
* üí° **Manage**: Free-form text checked for **banned** [word]s
* üîß **Configure**: Any free-form text permitted (no check)

The message preview is updated as the user composes the message.  When the
**Send** button is pressed, it is set as the `lock` attribute.  The server
performs a validation check ensuring the user has [permissions] for any
free-form text before sending the message to the sign.
