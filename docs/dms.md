* Querying diagnostic information
* Querying or sending [font]s
* Sending [graphic images] to be displayed
* [Travel time] estimation

## Setup

The DMS properties form has setup information.

Field          | Description
---------------|------------------------------------------------
Hashtags       | space-separated list of [hashtag]s for the sign
Remote beacon  | beacon activated automatically when sign deployed
Static graphic | image of static sign in which DMS is inset

**Internal** beacons are controlled through the DMS controller using the [NTCIP]
protocol.  **Remote** [beacon]s are controlled using a separate [comm link].

## Styles

Each DMS can have a number of _styles_, depending on its current state.  Styles
are ordered by precedence, determining which color a map marker is drawn.

Style     | Description
----------|---------------------------------------
Available | Sign is blank and ready to use
Deployed  | Displaying an operator-defined message
Schedule  | Displaying a scheduled message
External  | Displaying a message from an external system (not IRIS)
Maint.    | Sign requires maintenance, but might still be functional
Failed    | Communication failure to sign
Purpose   | [Dedicated purpose] sign
All       | All signs

## Composing Messages

When a DMS is selected, a few things happen:
- the sign's location is displayed
- the current message is rendered
- the [message pattern] selector is populated:
  * only patterns whose **compose** [hashtag] matches the sign
  * only patterns containing **NO** [action tags]

When an operator chooses a pattern, a series of selectors is populated with
[message lines], depending on the [fillable text rectangles].  Any lines which
are too wide to fit the sign are [abbreviated] as necessary.

The selectors may also allow **free-form text** entry, depending on the
permision access level of the user:

* ðŸ‘‰ **Operate**: No free-form text permitted
* ðŸ’¡ **Manage**: Free-form text checked for **banned** [word]s
* ðŸ”§ **Configure**: Any free-form text permitted (no check)

The message preview is updated as the user composes the message.  When the
**Send** button is pressed, a [sign message] is created and set as the operator
message.  The server then performs a validation check ensuring the user has
permission for any free-form text.
