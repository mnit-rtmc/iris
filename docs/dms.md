# Dynamic Message Signs (DMS)

Select `View âž” Message Signs âž” DMS` menu item

A _dynamic message sign_ (DMS) is a sign which is capable of changing the
message displayed to motorists.

The following features are supported:

* Querying currently displayed [sign message]
* Sending and displaying [sign message]s
* Querying [sign configuration]
* Querying diagnostic information
* Querying or sending [font]s
* Sending [graphic images] to be displayed
* [Travel time] estimation
* [Variable speed advisories]
* [Slow traffic] warnings
* Checking banned or allowed [word] lists

| Access       | Minimal                      | Full        |
|--------------|------------------------------|-------------|
| Read Only    | name, location, msg\_current | sign\_config, sign\_detail, geo\_loc, msg\_sched, status, stuck\_pixels |

| ðŸ”§ Configure | controller                   | pin         |

## Setup

The DMS properties form has setup information.

Field          | Description
---------------|-------------------------------------------------
Hashtags       | space-separated list of tags for selecting signs
Remote beacon  | beacon activated automatically when sign deployed
Static graphic | image of static sign in which DMS is inset
Device purpose | _general_ or _dedicated_ purpose for sign operation
Hidden         | hide sign when _available_ or _deployed_ styles are selected

A **hashtag** is the `#` character, followed by a string of letters and/or
numbers.  They are used to select signs for:
- [message pattern]s for composing
- automated [DMS actions]
- [alert configurations] and [alert messages]
- [lane-use MULTI] indications

**Internal** beacons are controlled through the DMS controller using the [NTCIP]
protocol.  **Remote** [beacon]s are controlled using a separate [comm link].

## Operating

Each DMS can have a number of _styles_, depending on its current state.  Styles
are ordered by precedence, determining which color a map marker is drawn.

Style     | Description
----------|---------------------------------------
Available | Sign is blank and ready to use
Deployed  | Displaying an operator-defined message
Schedule  | Displaying a scheduled message
External  | Displaying a message from an external system (not IRIS)
Maint.    | Sign requires maintenance, but might still be functional
Failed    | Communication failure to sign
Purpose   | _Dedicated-purpose_ sign (travel time, wayfinding, etc.)
All       | All signs

## Composing Messages

When a DMS is selected, a few things happen:
- the sign's location is displayed
- the current message is rendered
- the [message pattern] selector is populated:
  * only patterns whose **compose** hashtag matches the sign
  * only patterns containing **NO** [action tags]

When a pattern is selected, a series of selectors is populated with message
lines, depending on the text rectangles of that pattern.  The message preview
is updated as the message is being composed.  Once complete, pressing the
**Send** button will create a [sign message] and put it onto the DMS.
