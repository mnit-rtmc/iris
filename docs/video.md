# Video Monitors

A _video monitor_ is a dedicated screen which can display [camera] streams in
real time.  IRIS can quickly switch the stream and title text displayed on a
video monitor, using supported [protocol]s.

## MonStream

[MonStream] is a full-screen video streaming application which runs on low-cost
Linux computers.  IRIS has a _MonStream_ [protocol] driver, which can be used
for video monitor control.

A computer running MonStream can be configured to stream a grid of four or more
video feeds onto a single large monitor.  The only configuration required on the
MonStream computer is to grant access to the `/var/lib/monstream/` directory for
the UID of the monstream process.

A [controller] must be configured to represent each MonStream computer.  It will
need to be on a [comm link] using the MonStream protocol, with a timeout of 2000
ms.  The comm link URI should be of the form: `[ip address]:7001`.  Each video
monitor to be displayed should be associated with an [IO pin] of the controller.
For example, a quad-screen monitor would have monitors associated with pins 1
thru 4.

## Configuration

Select `View ➔ Video ➔ Video Monitor` menu item

Each row of the table represents one _video monitor_.

Field         | Description
--------------|---------------------------------------------------
Name          | Video monitor name
Notes         | Location or usage text
Group name    | [Privilege] group, for access control
Monitor num   | Number for selecting and switching
Restricted    | Flag restricting monitor to published cameras only
Monitor style | [Style](#style) of title bar, _etc_

The `monitor num` is used to identify monitors when selecting [camera]s with
a [switching](#switching) system.

## Style

Select `View ➔ Video ➔ Monitor Styles` menu item

Field         | Description
--------------|---------------------------------------------------
Monitor Style | Monitor style name
Force aspect  | Flag to preserve video aspect ratio
Accent        | Hexadecimal RGB color of title bar
Font Size     | Size of title bar font (points)
Title Bar     | Flag to enable title bar
Auto Expand   | Flag to use full screen when only one monitor is active

## Switching

There are several methods available for switching video monitors.  Using any of
these methods, when a [camera] is assigned to a `monitor num`, **all** monitors
and [flow streams] with that number will be switched.

### Camera Tab

On the upper-right of the **Camera** tab, there is a `monitor num` selector.
The number chosen here will be switched any time a camera is selected, either
from the map or a list.

The [selector tool] can also be used to change the `monitor num` or camera.

### Keyboards

Certain [camera keyboards] can be used for video monitor switching.

### MonStream Control

With a USB joystick and keypad, a [MonStream](#monstream) computer can be used
for switching.

## Play Lists

Select `View ➔ Video ➔ Play Lists` menu item

Play lists can be created to cycle through related [camera]s.  Each user can
have a personal play list, but system play lists are available to all users.
Selecting a play list on a monitor will cause the play list to automatically
switch.  The interval is specified by the `camera_sequence_dwell_sec`
[system attribute].

## Catalogs

A catalog is a collection of play lists.  Both play lists and catalogs can be
assigned sequence numbers, so they can be used in the same way.
