# Comm Links

Select `View ➔ Maintenance ➔ Comm Links` menu item

A **comm link** is a network connection to an external [device] or system.  IRIS
is capable of supporting thousands of simultaneous comm links.

## URI

The **URI** includes a DNS host name or network IP address, and port number,
using the standard `host:port` convention.  It can also contain an optional
**scheme** prefix, which can be either `udp://`, `tcp://` or `modem://`.  If
present, the scheme will override the _default scheme_ for the selected
protocol.  For example, to use the [Pelco-D](#pelco-d) protocol over TCP
(instead of the default UDP), prepend `tcp://` to the URI.

## Poll Enabled

Polling can be disabled using this value.

# Comm Config

Select `View ➔ Maintenance ➔ Comm Config` menu item

## Modem

The **modem** flag indicates the connection uses a _dial-up_ or _cell_ modem.

## Poll Period

Poll **period** determines how frequently controllers on a comm link are polled.
It can range from 5 seconds to 24 hours.

## Long Poll Period

This **period** is for less frequently performed polling operations, determined
by the protocol.  For modem links with restricted bandwidth, it may be useful if
both poll periods use the same (long) value, to reduce costs.

## Timeout

After a poll, if a response is not received before the **timeout** expires, the
communicaton will fail.  For each poll, 2 retries will happen before the
operation is aborted.

## Idle Disconnect

When this value is greater than zero, the comm link will be disconnected after
a period of inactivity.  This can reduce charges for modem links.

## No Response Disconnect

When this value is greater than zero, the comm link will be disconnected after
no response is received from a poll for the specified time.

## Protocols

**Protocol** determines what type of [device] or system is on the other end of
the comm link.  Each protocol supports specific device types.  Some protocols
support **multi-drop** addressing, with multiple controllers per _comm link_.

### Axis PTZ

The `axisptz` protocol can be used for [PTZ] control of Axis [camera]s.  The
_default scheme_ is `http`.  _Multi-drop_ is not supported.  One camera can be
associated with each [controller], using [IO pin] 1.

### Canoga

The `canoga` protocol can collect [vehicle detection] data, with
[vehicle logging] instead of [binned data].  The _default scheme_ is `tcp`.
_Multi-drop_ is supported with drops 1 - 255.  Up to 4 detectors can be
associated with each [controller], using [IO pin]s 1 - 4.

### CAP

The Common Alerting Protocol [CAP] is used for polling feeds such as the
Integrated Public Alert and Warning System [IPAWS].  [Alerts] can be used to
automatically post weather and other messages to Dynamic Message Signs.  For
IPAWS, this requires an `HTTPS` URI provided by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency and a [controller] set to `ACTIVE` condition.

### CBW

The `cbw` protocol can be used for [beacons], using a Control-By-Web controller.
The _default scheme_ is `http`.  _Multi-drop_ is not supported.  Up to 8
[beacons] can be associated with each [controller], using [IO pin]s 1 - 8.

### Cohu

The `cohu` protocol can be used for [PTZ] control of Cohu [camera]s.  The

The _default scheme_ is `udp`.  _Multi-drop_ is not supported.  One tag reader
can be associated with each [controller], using [IO pin] 1.

### G4

The `G4` protocol can collect [vehicle detection] data, including _vehicle
counts_, _occupancy_, _speed_ and _vehicle classification_.  The
_default scheme_ is `tcp`.  _Multi-drop_ is supported with drops 0 - 65535.
Up to 12 detectors can be associated with each [controller], using [IO pin]s
1 - 12.

### Inc-Feed

The `incfeed` protocol can be used to interface IRIS with an external system
that generates [incidents].  Periodically, IRIS will poll the URI (using `http`)
for incidents.

#### Incident Feed Format

The external system should respond with an ASCII text file, with one line per
active incident.

Each line should contain 7 fields, separated by comma characters `,` and
terminated with a single newline character `\n` (ASCII 0x0A).  The fields are:

1. **incident ID**
2. **type**: `CRASH`, `STALL`, `ROADWORK` or `HAZARD`
3. **incident detail**: may be blank, or one of the _incident detail_ names
4. **latitude**
5. **longitude**
6. **camera ID**: may be blank, or the ID of a [camera] to view the incident
7. **direction**: `NB`, `SB`, `EB` or `WB`

_Latitude_ and _longitude_ define coördinates using the WGS 84 datum.

### Infinova

The `infinova` protocol can be used for [PTZ] control of Infinova [camera]s.
The _default scheme_ is `tcp`.  _Multi-drop_ is supported with drops 1 - 254.
One camera can be associated with each [controller], using [IO pin] 1.

### Manchester

The _default scheme_ is `udp`.  _Multi-drop_ is supported with drops 1 - 1024.
One camera can be associated with each [controller], using [IO pin] 1.

### MnDOT-170

170 style controllers running the _MnDOT 170_ firmware can support several types
of [device]s:

Device Type         | `#` | [IO Pin]s
--------------------|-----|----------
[vehicle detection] | 24  | 39 - 62
[ramp meters]       | 2   | 2 - 3
[changeable LCS]    | 3   | 19 - 36
[beacons]           | 1   | 2
[alarms]            | 10  | 70 - 79

There are two versions of the protocol supported:

Version   | Default Scheme | Multi-Drop
----------|----------------|-----------
4         | `tcp`          | 1 - 15
5         | `tcp`          | 1 - 31

### MonStream

The `monstream` protocol can be used for switching of [monstream] video
monitors.  The _default scheme_ is `udp`.  _Multi-drop_ is not supported.
Up to 16 [video monitors] can be associated with each [controller], using
[IO pin]s 1 - 16.

### Msg-Feed

The `msgfeed` protocol can be used to interface with an external system that
generates [DMS] messages.  Periodically, IRIS will poll the URI (using `http`)
for DMS messages.

#### Msg-Feed Format

The external system should respond with an ASCII text file, with one line per
message to be deployed.

Each line must contain 3 fields, separated by tab characters `\t` (ASCII 0x09),
and terminated with a single newline character `\n` (ASCII 0x0A).  The fields
are **DMS name**, [MULTI] **string**, and **expiration time**.  The _DMS name_
must exactly match one of the DMS as identified by IRIS.  The _MULTI string_
specifies a message to display on the sign, using the _MULTI_ markup language.
The _expiration time_ field indicates the date and time that the message should
expire, in [RFC 3339] format, with `full-date` and `full-time` separated by a
space instead of `T`.
```
V66E37	CRASH[nl]5 MILES AHEAD[nl]LEFT LANE CLOSED	2019-10-02 11:37:00-05:00
```

#### Msg-Feed Action Plan

An [action plan] is required to associate a [DMS action] with the feed.  The
_DMS action_ must have a [quick message] with a `feed` [action tag]:

`[feed` *n* `]`

So, if the _message feed_ is on a _Comm Link_ called `LFEED`, then the quick
message [MULTI] string must be `[feedLFEED]`.  Also, the _action plan_ must be
active and deployed.  This requirement allows only administrator-approved DMS to
be controlled by the message feed.

#### Msg-Feed Text

All messages used by the feed must be defined in the DMS message library.  This
requirement allows only administrator-approved messages to be deployed by the
_message feed_.  In some circumstances, it may be appropriate to disable this
checking.  For example, if the message feed host is fully trusted and there is
no possibility of man-in-the-middle attacks between IRIS and the feed host.  In
this case the `msg_feed_verify` [system attribute] can be set to `false` to
disable this check.

#### Msg-Feed Beacons

To activate DMS [beacons] through a message feed, configure 2 message feeds.
One is for DMS containing messages with activated beacons and the other for
messages with deactivated beacons.  There is no way to control which message
feed is executed first, so each message feed must list each DMS and at least one
of the message feeds must contain a blank _MULTI_ for each DMS.

### NTCIP

_National Transportation Communications for Intelligent transportation system
Protocol_ is supported for several different [device] types:

* [DMS] — _NTCIP 1203_
* [LCS], using _DMS_ for lane control

from Wavetronix sensors.  The `105` and `125 HD` protocols collect binned
_vehicle counts_, _occupancy_, _speed_ and _vehicle classification_.  The
`125 vlog` protocol logs event data for every vehicle.  The _default scheme_ is
`tcp`.
